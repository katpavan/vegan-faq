Soren Kierkegaard's Life Lessons Should Be Known Early To Avoid Regrets

* It is very important in life to know when your cue comes.
  
* the highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but if one will, are to be lived.

animals never experience the freedom that you do. they're trapped. then they have a 3 to 10 day trip to a slaughter house where they receive no water or food and are dragged to the kill floor or gas chamber. 

* the opposite of courage isn't cowardice, it is conformity.
* Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory.
* You become what you understand.
* Knowledge is a wealth that cannot be stolen

* the most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you'll never have
* Take a chance, and you may lose; take not a chance, and you have lost already.
