how i became vegan

In college I saw some footage from an activist and it gave me nightmares. I stopped eat meat for a few months after that, but didn't know what to eat or how to cook. So I ate milk and unhealthy cereal for 2 months LOL. needless to say it didn't make me feel good. After they shocked me, I wish they gave me a pamphlet explaining how each animal product is bad and why, a sample vegan meal plan and a link to a bunch of easy meals to make and a support forum. I probably would have gone vegan because it really did a number on me. I couldn't stick to eating milk and cereal forever, so I went back to the way things were. Every now and then I'd think about the animals from the video and I'd get nausea and feel extreme guilt, but I didn't want to eat milk and cereal forever. Later on after college, my gf went vegetarian and I instantly became vegetarian. I always wanted to be one and with her help I knew maybe we could do it. We did it and I still avoided all docs because the last one I saw 6 years before kicked my ass to that day. Eventually I saw footage on facebook from a dairy farm. It gave me nightmares. I instantly became vegan, but it wasn't enough. I became an activist and worked on laws, went on protests and handed out pamphlets, I started donating monthly to sanctuaries.

Such a thorough piece, providing the facts to dispel all the bullshit we are encouraged to believe about the wool industry…
Excerpt: 
Although wool shearing is widely misperceived as merely a benign “haircut” for sheep, the modern sheep industry, like all industries that mass produce animals, is egregiously violent. Sheep are subjected to painful mutilations like tail docking and mulesing, a procedure in which skin from their hindquarters is cut off to prevent flystrike, a parasitic infection the animals are prone to because of how they’ve been bred.
Many appalling undercover videos of wool production have emerged over the years, showing sheep beaten and wounded by clippers as workers restrain them and shear off their hair as quickly as possible. Eventually, they’re sent to slaughter.

----
The argument I use is to relate the animals as being voiceless. Sure eating them gives pleasure, but as a society we've condemned and made it illegal to take pleasure in exploiting part of the voiceless. There are people who watch CP and although they're not directly hurting children, they're certainly contributing to the exploitation and suffering of children and that's why we made it illegal and have condemned CP.

I finish it off with how John Wayne Gacy raped and murdered little boys and he was treated better than a baby cow that did nothing to anyone.

hunting
overpopulation is common why hunt deer
then why hunt bucks, the females pregnate
if you cared about the animal, why do bow hunting? that's far more painful and recovery of the animal isn't 100%. large part of the time the animal isnt recovered, bleeds out and is eaten alive.
if you cared about overpopulation then why hunt coyotes lol. they use reasoning around underpopulation of deer for that.
at the end of the day, hunters hunt because it's fun and they want to brag about the heads on the wall to their friends.


Regardless of how you view Bill Gates, the fact remains that the majority of our freshwater and farmland is dedicated to raising 750 billion animals for food, which poses a significant problem. These animals are fed and given water annually, only to be killed for food, while a large portion of the world suffers from water and food scarcity. We give water and food to 750b animals that are killed in horrific ways while we can't feed and give water to the 10b people on earth? What? Additionally, the massive amount of waste generated by these animals pollutes local environments and has dire health consequences for the people living in those areas. Furthermore, the CO2 and methane emissions from these 750 billion animals contribute to climate change. However, lab-grown meat and plant-based meat companies are making efforts to address these issues and create a sustainable future for future generations to enjoy. (Sources: 1. "Meat's Environmental Impact" - NPR, 2. "Meat and the Environment" - World Wildlife Fund, 3. "The Case for Plant-Based" - Beyond Meat, 4. "Lab-Grown Meat: A Solution for Sustainable Food Production?" - Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems)


yes there are plant based foods not good for the environment, but all animal based foods are bad for the planet. we some how raise 750billion animals each year, give them food and water and kill them but yet people starve and can't get fresh water.
 
local beekeepers buy commercial bees that infect wildflowers with diseases and kill those bees and ecosystems. there are very few beekeepers that support wildbees. they but the bees and get them shipped from china

this isn't true. ethical honey doesn't exist. beekeepers get their bees from factory farms in china. the bees are shipped to them. these bees are diseased because they're farmed in close quarters. then these bees spread their diseases to wildflowers and that's why wild bees are dying and the ecosystems around them are getting screwed. on top of that, beekeepers kill their bees for winter and perpetually keep them weak by taking all their honey and leaving sugar water. beekeepers aren't environmentalists. they're profit seekers.

why do we have canines if we're meant to eat plantS?
Hippopotamus – Hippopotamuses have the largest teeth of any land animal. Their canine teeth can grow to be 1.5 feet long and their front incisors grow to be around 1.2 feet long!


"I was given a couple of rats as a gift once. I'd never considered them as pets, but they won me over with their charm and intelligence. Mine even took great care of each other. One of them got a bit sick, and the other one brought her food and kept her clean and comfortable until she got better."

My husband and I raised chickens for eggs over the past 3 years. It taught us a lot about how amazing these birds are and how horrible their genetics are for basic life functions. Due to their engineered, hyper reproductive (essentially cancerous) state, about 1 in 3 chickens will develop ovarian cancer by the time they are 2.5 years of age!!! I honestly thought the biggest threats to my birds were infectious, but in less than 4 years we lost half our flock to reproductive causes (ovarian cancer and internal egg laying). Witnessing this has honestly given us a whole new perspective to these industries and the hard lives that these production birds and farmers face in keeping these birds alive. Can we not seriously revisit other breeds of birds for the egg industry OR try to engineer birds that can live a healthier more disease free life in addition to satisfying our desire for eggs?

It's not fair to ignore ethics. Spousal abuse was legal for a long time. It wasn't until the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993 that violence in a marriage would result in consequences. Protecting the weak is important.

"I am Indigenous, Rosebud Sioux and Yakama Nation and I'm also vegan.

The reason I went vegan was because of my Indigenous culture, I was taught to treat animals with respect.

When I was 5 years old my uncle took us hunting, he shot an Elk, we found it and it was bleeding out.

He pulled out some tobacco and said a prayer for it, he thanked it for all the resources it would supply our family with. He hushed it to sleep and stabbed it, killing off the elk.

As I got older I realized the way I eat had no tie to the animals, it had NO RESPECT for the animals.

I could just go to the store and get as much meat and dairy as I wanted without paying my respects to the animal.

So, me going vegan was directly tied to my relation with Indigenous culture.

Edit: This is when I grew up on the reservation and with the resources I had, this was out of necessity. Then as I got older and moved away to attend University is when I realized my disconnect"

“you’re trying to make me feel guilty”
- that's your conscience

the main reason for eating meat, drinking milk, eating eggs, fish, honey is because you enjoy their taste. 

1. Chickens can recognize over 100 different faces!
2. Hens talk to their chicks even before they hatch! The mother cackles to them, and they chirp back to her from the egg.
3. Hens are remarkably devoted mothers. They will protect their chicks at any cost, and tuck them under her wings at night to sleep.
4. In nature, chickens can fly and love to sleep in trees!
5. Contrary to popular opinion, chickens are very intelligent animals. They have amazing problem solving abilities, excellent memories, and can even correctly solve math exercises!
In the egg industry, hens don't get to spread their wings. They don't get to get to incubate the eggs they laboriously laid, or raise their babies.  They will never do all the things that they would do naturally — feel the earth under their feet, see the sky or take a sand bath.  This breaks our hearts, and we wish all chickens could live freely and as happily as they are at Freedom Farm Sanctuary.

## pigs

https://sentientmedia.org/prop-12-oral-arguments/

The footage was filmed this summer by a Mercy investigator inside a 
Minnesota farm that sells piglets to be raised at “finishing farms” for 
slaughter. Pigs can be heard squealing loudly in their crates, and piglets 
cry out as they are castrated without anesthesia – a standard industry 
practice. Among other documented incidents, the investigation found pigs 
bleeding and injured, and the bodies of newly born piglets on the floor. 

Pigs in the footage suffer from prolapses (Uterine prolapse occurs when 
pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken until they no longer 
provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down 
into or protrudes out of the vagina.)
