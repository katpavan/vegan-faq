pigs

The footage was filmed this summer by a Mercy investigator inside a 
Minnesota farm that sells piglets to be raised at “finishing farms” for 
slaughter. Pigs can be heard squealing loudly in their crates, and piglets 
cry out as they are castrated without anesthesia – a standard industry 
practice. Among other documented incidents, the investigation found pigs 
bleeding and injured, and the bodies of newly born piglets on the floor. 

Pigs in the footage suffer from prolapses (Uterine prolapse occurs when 
pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken until they no longer 
provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down 
into or protrudes out of the vagina.)
